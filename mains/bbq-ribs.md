# BBQ Smoked Ribs

## Ingredients
- 1 slab baby back ribs, cleaned (remove membrane on back, if needed)

### Rub
- See bbq-rub.md
- 1/4 c brown sugar

### Baste
- 4 tbsp apple cider
- 2 tbsp apricot preserves 
- 2 tbsp ketchup (testing!)

## Directions

Put rub on ribs (not too much). Put brown sugar on ribs. 

Set smoke up with applewood and water pan. Smoke at 250F for 2-3 hours, rotating and flipping half way through.

Baste on top-side only. Wrap tightly with foil (no holes!), and cook for 1-2 hours (bone side down). Monitor temperature, aiming for 180-190 or until fully tender (bone can be twisted)

Remove from foil, and cook on grates for 30-60 minutes until glaze tightens up.
