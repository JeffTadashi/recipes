### Broth
- 2000ml water
- 15cm piece of kombu
- 30g dried bonito flakes
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce
### Remaining Mix-ins

## Directions
Soak kombu in the measured cold water for 30 mins. Then bring slowly to boil, and remove the kombu before it reaches full boil. 

Then add bonito flakes and simmer for 1-2mins. Turn off heat, and wait for bonito to sink (~10mins). Then filter out the bonito, and put broth into ceramic/serving vessel.

Add remaining broth ingredients. (Save some broth on the side, if there is more than needed)

Meanwhile, cut the cooked kombu into 2cm wide strips, and tie into bows/knots.
