# Hot Pot
Based on Mikey Chen's quick hot pot recipe!

## Ingredients
### Broth
- 6 slices of ginger
- 6 cloves of garlic, whole
- 1 green onion, cut into 1 inch pieces
- 8 cups chicken stock
- 10 dried chilies (chinese)
- 10 dried dates
### Broth - Bouquet Garni
- 4 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 6 bay leaves
- 1 tbsp sichuan peppercorns, whole
- 1 tbsp goji berries
### Broth - For Spicy
- Sichuan Chili Bean Paste
- Chinese dried chilis
- Green onion, garlic, ginger as needed
- Beef fat
### Sauce
- 1.5 tbsp Chinese bbq sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame paste
- 1 tsp Chinese vinegar
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- Hot oil to taste
- Garlic, minced, to taste
- Green onion, chopped, to taste
- Sesame seeds, to taste
- Cilantro, chopped, to taste

## Directions
Adjust sauce ingredient proportions to your personal tastes.

In the hot pot, heat up some oil and briefly cook garlic and ginger until fragrant and garlic is slightly browed. Add remaining ingredients: Note the spices that need to be placed in a bouquet garni (cloth pouch)

Boil for 5 minutes, then it's ready! The bouquet garni can be removed after about 30, to prevent those spices from getting too strong.

(For spicy broth, boil the chilis until soft, then mash. Then combine all ingredients in the fat, and fry briefly over low heat, or until oil is red)
