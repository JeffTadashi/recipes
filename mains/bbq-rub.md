This is taken directly from Craig Tabor's BBQ Green Egg book.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 c kosher salt
- 1/2 c freshly ground black pepper

- 5 tbsp smoked paprika (can substitute up to half with normal paprika)

## Notes

Generally for ribs or pork, add additional brown sugar for sweetness. This rub is used as-is for brisket
